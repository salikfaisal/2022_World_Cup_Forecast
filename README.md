# 2022_World_Cup_Forecast
This project predicts the results of the World Cup by simulating it 10,000 times. <br>

Each team's probabilities are based off of updated games completed in the World Cup, [Elo Ratings](http://www.eloratings.net/), and [SPI ratings](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/soccer-api/international/spi_global_rankings_intl.csv).

You can find both the [Group Stage Forecast](https://github.com/salikfaisal/2022_World_Cup_Forecast/blob/main/Group_Stage_Forecast_Results.csv) and the [Knockout Stage Forceast](https://github.com/salikfaisal/2022_World_Cup_Forecast/blob/main/Knockout_Stage_Forecast_Results.csv), which includes the probability of each team winning the World Cup.

Updates are made after the completion of **ALL** matches on a particular day for the Group Stage and after the completion of all games for a particular Knockout Round.
